## Description
This is the 20th challenge for my Coding bootcamp journey. For this challenge, we had to follow acceptance criteria to create a React app portfolio to replace the portfolio we had created using barebones HTML/CSS in week 3.

This application utilizes `React` as well as `Tailwind CSS` and the `framer motion` package to handle dynamic div elements.

-TODO: Currently I am working on adding a picture of myself to the landing screen. 

-TODO: Working on fixing the project pictures / display in the projects section.

-TODO: Will Add a Resume to my Portfolio once its updated.
